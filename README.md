1. use an external REST API (for example https://openweathermap.org/guide) to fetch information from some service, 

	1.1 and integrate it into your web page. It doesn't have to be weather, feel free to choose something relevant to your application


2. create a REST endpoint that responds to a GET request, 

	2.1 returning a list of items from your application (e.g. /api/foo ) 

	2.2 as well as accepting an item ID and returning detailed information about that item (e.g. /api/foo/123  where 123 is the item ID)
